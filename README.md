# Vibrational Spectroscopy Ontology

_WIP - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION_ The Vibrational Spectroscopy Ontology (ViSprO) is used to represent information regarding the excution and analysis of vibrational spectroscopy assays.

**For more documentation please go to: https://nfdi4chem.github.io/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/**

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationSpectroscopyOntology/blob/main/vispro.owl


### Editors' version

Editors of this ontology should use the edit version, [src/ontology/vispro-edit.owl](src/ontology/vispro-edit.owl)

Another approach of curating terms (e.g. for non Protégé experienced domain experts) is to edit [src/templates/vispro_terms.tsv](src/templates/vispro_terms.tsv) and then let the repo maintainers run `sh run.sh make recreate-components`.

## Contact

Please use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationSpectroscopyOntology/issues) to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.
