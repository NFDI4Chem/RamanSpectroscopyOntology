In order to let you help us improve the documentation of the ontology, we encourage you to provide enough details such as the following:

## Write short but precise issue titles
Please use short but precise issue titles that make clear what your problem with the documentation is. 
(e.g. [Docs] Why are there only so few data properties in VIBSO?)

## Provide a detailed description of your problem and where in the documentation you would have expected the answer
(e.g. As a domain expert I want to request a new term but am not sure what the proper parent class is. How can I decide this? I couldn't find anything regarding this in the [Development Approach](https://nfdi4chem.github.io/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/development_approach/) or [How-To - contributing](https://nfdi4chem.github.io/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/contributing/) section.)

## Please provide examples
(Having screenshots or other expressive examples would really help.)
