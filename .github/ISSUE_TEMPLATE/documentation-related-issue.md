In order to improve the documentation of the ontology regarding the repository layout, design decisions and patterns, tutorials or How-Tos, we encourage you to provide enough details such as the following:

## Write short but precise issue titles
Please use short but precise issue titles that make clear what your problem is. 
(e.g. Why are there only so few data properties in VIBSO?)

## Provide a concrete use case
(e.g. As a domain expert I want to request a new term but am not sure what the proper parent class is. How can I decide this?)

## Make sure you have read the docs first and provide links to where you would have expected this missing information
(e.g. in the How To section or in the design decision section)

## Please provide examples
Having screenshots or other expressive examples would really help
