	method	The precise type of the Raman spectroscopy / microscopy experiment. Admitted values: "Single spectrum"; "Line scan/mapping"; "Vertical mapping"; "2D mapping"; "3D mapping".								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519				From this attribute depends the population of some of the other fields below - e.g. the spatial resolution in the X/Y/Z direction makes sense only for scanning experiments in that direction	
	excitation light power on the sample	Power measured before the sample holder. It depends on the laser power and on the dispersive behaviour of the filters and optical components								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
obo:VIBSO_0000011	excitation wavelength	A physical quality of the light source that is used used to excite a system to a higher energy state.	DOI:10.1351/goldbook	owl:Class	wavelength					ORCID:0000-0002-1595-3213			This class needs to be defined in PATO or another more general ontology for such qualities.	OK, very important parameter!	In general, use the label ending "...setting" coherently: either for all inputs (per hand or multiple choice) or never.
obo:VIBSO_0000001	exposure time setting	A setting datum that specifies the duration in which an electromagnetic radiation beam is exposed to / recorded by a photosensor.		owl:Class	setting datum					ORCID:0000-0002-1595-3213			This class should better be defined in a more general device ontology or a domain ontology with the scope of optical devices.	"Single integration time" sounds better.	
	number of repetitions	The number of acquisitions on the same location, without position change.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
	total integration time	The product of single integration time and number of repetitions.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519			Remark the trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio and resolution.	These three parameter together are redundant. Possibly the single exposure time is the one which can be sacrified.	
obo:VIBSO_0000006	number of scans setting	A setting datum that specifies the number of iterations performed in a spectroscopic measurement from which an aggregated assay output is generated.		owl:Class	setting datum|('part of' some 'vibrational spectrometer configuration specification')					ORCID:0000-0002-1595-3213		The setting entered into a Raman microscope which specifies the desired number of measurements this Raman microscope has to perform to produce an usable Raman spectrum.	This class should better be defined in a more general device ontology.	OK	
obo:VIBSO_0000005	device temperature setting	A setting datum that specifies the operating temperature of a device.		owl:Class	setting datum					ORCID:0000-0002-1595-3213			This class should better be defined in a more general device ontology.	OK - often useful to know the operating temperature.When applied to 2D mappings, this would require a temperature record throughout the measurement time to be able to correlate deviations in the mapping with temperature fluctuations.	A "temperature record" is more relevant rather than a "temperature setting", specially for long measurements (time-resolved record)
	objective magnification	The magnification factor of the objective collecting the scattered light.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
obo:VIBSO_0000009	groove density	A physical quality of a diffraction grating that represents the number of grooves per length unit (e.g. mm) on the surface that causes the diffraction of the light.	Wikipedia:Diffraction_grating	owl:Class	physical quality					ORCID:0000-0002-1595-3213			This class should better be defined in a more general device ontology or a domain ontology with the scope of optical devices.	OK, important parameter to calculate the spectral resolution.	
obo:VIBSO_0000008	CCD sensor binning read mode setting	A setting datum that specifies the binning read mode of a device with a CCD sensor.		owl:Class	setting datum					ORCID:0000-0002-1595-3213			This class should better be defined in a more general device ontology or a domain ontology with the scope of optical devices.	Which values can this property assume? Is it a density expressed in cm-1 / (virtual pixel)? Or (CCD pixel) / (virtual pixel)? It might be relevant as it contributes to the resolution / smoothing of the spectra, but in a complicated combination with the exit slit width	"spatial integration width" would be a better label.
	spatial range X	The width of the region of interest in the X direction.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519				Same for Y, Z, â€¦	
	number of points X	The number of measurement points in the X direction.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
	resolution X	The number of points per unit length in the X direction.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
	spectral window range:minimum	Calculated from window size and window center.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
	spectral window range:maximum	Calculated from window size and window center.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519					
	signal-to-noise ratio	The ratio between the height of the lowest relevant peak and the root-mena-square height of the background signal. It requires the (somehow arbitrary) choice about what is or is not a relevant signal.								ORCID:0000-0001-7694-5519			Provide a univoque definition
