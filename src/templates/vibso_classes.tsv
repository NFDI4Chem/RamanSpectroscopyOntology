obo:VIBSO_0000044	temporal resolution interval		resolution interval	A resolution interval that quantifies the temporal separation between two measurements or frames, often expressed as the inverse of the frame rate. In techniques where temporal resolution is not directly derived from frame rate, it quantifies the minimum temporal interval between two resolvable events.
