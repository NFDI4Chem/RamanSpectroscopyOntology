ex:_Raman_Spectroscopy_Method_1	_Raman_Spectroscopy_Method_1	The information that indicates the type of _Raman_Spectroscopy_1 by describing its method, specifying its inputs and outputs, as well as the necessary steps and actions that have to be taken in order to achieve _Raman_Spectrum_Objective_1. For the sake of keeping it simple, not all parts of this assay specification will be provided as assertions on this example.	investigation assay specification						_Raman_Spectrum_Objective_1,_Wavelength_Setting_Info_1	_Raman_Spectroscopy_1,_Raman_Spectrometer_1
ex:_Raman_Spectrum_Objective_1	_Raman_Spectrum_Objective_1	The information that specifies the intended outcome of _Raman_Spectroscopy_1 to be the creation of a Raman Spectrum.	assay objective
ex:_Wavelength_Setting_Info_1	_Wavelength_Setting_Info_1	The information that determines the wavelength of the laser of _Raman_Spectrometer_1 which is used to excite the sample. This information gets encoded by the _Laser_Value_Specification_1. 	excitation wavelength setting								_Laser_Wavelength_1	_Wavelength_Value_Specification_1
ex:_Laser_Wavelength_1	_Laser_Wavelength_1	The laser wavelength of _Raman_Spectrometer_1 which is a general attribute (aka quality/characteristic) of _Raman_Spectrometer_1. The quantity of this attribute is represented by the _Wavelength_Value_Specification_1.	wavelength					_Raman_Spectrometer_1
ex:_Wavelength_Value_Specification_1	_Wavelength_Value_Specification_1	The encoding of the value determined by _Wavelength_Setting_Info_1, which consists of the unit label and the literal value of the laser wavelength of _Raman_Spectrometer_1.	scalar value specification										_Laser_Wavelength_1	555.00^^xsd:float	nanometer
