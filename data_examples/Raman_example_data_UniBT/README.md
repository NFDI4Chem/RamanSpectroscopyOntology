# This folder contains informations about two public datasets with Raman spectra. Since datasets are stored on the ZENODO repository, here only the links will be provided.

## 1. [`Comparability of Raman Spectroscopic Configurations: A Large Scale Cross-Laboratory Study`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4152952)

Data: Slightly processed raw data (spike removal to allow an interpolation to a common wavenumber axis) from different sources
Metadata fields: sample measured

## 2. [`Raman spectra of the Adenoma-Carcinoma-Sequence in a mice model`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3905057)

Data: averaged spectra in vivo
Metadata fields: mouse ID, nr of scans collected from each mouse, location of extracted scans, activity of P53 gene, mouse gender, tissue type (grouped: normal vs HB vs adenoma vs carcinoma).
