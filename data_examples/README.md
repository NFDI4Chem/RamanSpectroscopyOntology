This folder is used to collect data examples of vibrational spectroscopy assay input and output files that are part of a typical vibrational spectroscopy dataset. 
We will focus on Raman spectroscopy datasets first, but other vibrational spectroscopy datasets are also very helpful.

If you have a dataset that you are permitted to share with us please feel free to make a pull request in which you upload it with a README file that provides its provenance and license information.

Thank You!
