# How to contribute to VISPRO

Thank you for being a part of the Open Science team and being interested in finding out how to help us!
All that you need to know on how to contribute to VIBSO should be covered within this documentation, or in the links it provides. If this isn't the case please let us know.

There are different ways in which you can do help:

* [Open up a new issue](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/issues/new/choose): For any kind of contributions we rely on the GitHub infrastructure for documentation. Thus, it is always preferred that you use one of our issue templates to let us know what needs to be done and how you might plan on contributing, before working on a pull request (PR). This way, we know who you are and can get in touch. (However, feel free to do a quick PR patch for any typos off course.)
    * Use [this template](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) to file bugs,
    * [this one](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New+Term+Request&template=new-term-request-issue-template.md&title=%5BNTR%5D) to make a new term request,
    * or [this one](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation-related-issue.md&title=%5BDocs%5D) to help us improve this documentation and ask questions about VIBSO.
* [Add new terms to VIBSO](ntr_workflow.md).
