The Vibrational Spectroscopy Ontology (VIBSO) is the first ontology to be developed by the [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/) project, which has as core aim to make research data FAIR. The scope of VIBSO is thus focused on the use case of providing the terminology with which research data can be annotated. Such annotations can either be in form of RDF knowledge graphs that use VIBSO terms directly within their triples, or the research data is formally described according to some metadata schema which keys are mapped to terms from VISBO and compatible ontologies in order to provide a common semantic defining ground. 

## Domain Definition
VIBSO's domain covers vibrational spectroscopy, which includes all those spectroscopic methods that probe the vibrational modes of molecules or crystals. More specifically, VIBSO is intended to be used to make statements about who did what kind of vibrational spectroscopy, with what kind of sample, device and device configuration, under what lab protocol, in the context of what investigation as well as producing what kind of outputs. A more detailed description of VIBSO's domain  and competency questions can be found [here](competency_questions.md).

As an [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) compliant ontology, VIBSO depends on importing many terms from existing ontologies, such as [BFO](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/bfo), [RO](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/ro), [IAO](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/iao) and [OBI](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/obi) but first and foremost from the [Chemical Methods Ontology CHMO](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/chmo). These imported external terms are being declared in individual text files ([/src/ontology/imports](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/tree/main/src/ontology/imports)) from which OWL modules will be build automatically, according to the standard import workflow documented in [here](odk-workflows/UpdateImports.md).

In the future, it might be possible that, due to its domain specific overlap, VIBSO will be somehow integrated into CHMO. At the moment however, it seems best to keep the two separated and extend CHMO in the places where it is needed to cover the use case of Research Data Management (RDM) in the domain of vibrational spectroscopy.
