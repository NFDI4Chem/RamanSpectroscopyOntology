# The ontology's competency questions

Competency questions are used to make sure an ontology is able to fulfill the desired use case, defining the semantic field that should be covered by the ontology. 

In the case of VSIPRO these are:

 * What kind of vibrational spectroscopy was performed?

 * In what context was it performed, e.g. as part of what study or investigation?

 * What protocol and devices were used?

 * What were the protocol parameters & device configurations?

 * Who was involved in the assay, e.g. PI, PhD, lab assistant etc.? (identified by a PID like ORCID at best)

 * What was the assayed sample, including its relevant attributes?

 * What assay outputs were produces, such as what spectra (e.g. different formats)?

 * What kind of pre- and post-processeing was done?

This list of competency questions represents a first draft and needs to be thoroughly discussed with the domain experts an
