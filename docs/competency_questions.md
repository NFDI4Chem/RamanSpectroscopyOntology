# VISBO's Competency Questions

Competency questions can be understood as the test cases with which one can check whether the ontology is in scope and covers the intended use case. Making statements by using the terms defined in the ontology including its imported external once, the competency questions should be answerable.

As previously mentioned VISBO's scope is the semantic description of vibrational spectroscopy research data. So far we have thus identified the following competency questions:

 * What kind of vibrational spectroscopy was performed?

 * In what context was it performed, e.g. as part of what study or investigation?

 * What protocol and devices were used?

 * What were the protocol parameters & device configurations?

 * Who was involved in the assay, e.g. PI, PhD, lab assistant etc.? (identified by a PID like ORCID at best)

 * What was the assayed sample, including its relevant attributes?

 * What assay outputs were produced, such as what spectra (e.g. different formats)?

 * What kind of pre- and post-processing was done?

This list represents only a first draft and needs to be thoroughly discussed with the domain experts and the NFDI4Chem community.
