_CAVE! This documentation is still a work in progress, as VIBSO is in a very early stage of development.

Welcome to the documentation of the **Vibrational Spectroscopy Ontology (VIBSO)**!

VIBSO is the first ontology to be developed by the [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/) project, which has as core aim to make research data FAIR. The scope of VIBSO is thus focused on the use case of providing the terminology with which research data can be annotated. Such annotations can either be in form of RDF knowledge graphs that use VIBSO terms directly within their triples, or the research data is formally described according to some metadata schema which keys are mapped to terms from VISBO and compatible ontologies in order to provide a common semantic defining ground. Following an incremental ontology development approach, we are first going to focus on the domain of vibrational Raman spectroscopy before coming to other vibrational spectroscopy assays, such as infrared spectroscopy.
